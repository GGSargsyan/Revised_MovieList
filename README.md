# Revised_MovieList
This will be a less awful version of my original MovieList project. 

The main differences between this MovieList and the original will be:
  1. javax.swing will be used to create a JPanel interface.
  2. I/O file will be replaced with microsoft excel sheets
  3. HashMap will be used to organize elements instead of an arraylist
  4. Structure will be improved to allow for JUnit testing
